Installation
============

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7 or higher (I'm currently working on Python 3.5)

Stable release
--------------

To install hdgnetwork, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install hdgnetwork

This is the preferred method to install hdgnetwork, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
